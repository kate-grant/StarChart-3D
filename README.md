# StarChart 3D (Async Week Project)

## About

StarChart is a 3D star map built in JavaScript with React, React Three Fiber and D3.js. There are many star map apps designed as interactive pocket guides for naked eye astronomy--these often come with a steep learning curve to their granular options. Similarly, the gyroscoping features that makes these apps great utilities for identifying local astral bodies can be disadvantageous to users aiming to learn the relative positions of constellations to each other because of the limited view and buouy-like movement. StarChart provides a steady, self-guided study aid for learning the relative positions of 88 officially recognized constellations.

Current star map defaults to the 1000 nearest stars to Earth. In the
future layers may be added to accomodate the full [HYG Database dataset](https://github.com/astronexus/HYG-Database) used in this project.

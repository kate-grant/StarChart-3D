        StarChart is a 3D star map built in JavaScript with React and React
        Three Fiber. There are many star map apps designed as interactive pocket
        guides for naked eye astronomy--these often come with a steep learning
        curve to their granular options. In general, the gyroscoping nature that
        makes these apps great at identifying local astral bodies can be a
        disadvantage to users trying to learn the relative positions of
        constellations to each other. StarChart provides a steady, self-guided
        study aid for learning the relative positions of 88 officially
        rocognized constellations.{" "}
